<h4><a href="https://defcongroups.org/">DEF CON&reg; Groups</a></h4>
<h5>
The DEF CON Groups were spawned from the annual DEF CON security conference in
Las Vegas. The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for
folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred
to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other
computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering
place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are
open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs
are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in
areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker
culture and it's members.
