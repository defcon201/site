<h4><a href="https://defcongroups.org/">DEF CON&reg; Groups</a></h4>
<h5>
The DEF CON Groups were spawned from the annual DEF CON security conference in
Las Vegas. The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for
folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred
to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other
computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering
place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are
open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs
are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in
areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker
culture and it's members.

Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that black girls can code,
and do so much more. By reaching out to the community through workshops and
after school programs, Black Girls CODE introduces computer coding lessons
to young girls from underrepresented communities in programming languages
such as Scratch or Ruby on Rails. Black Girls CODE has set out to prove to
the world that girls of every color have the skills to become the programmers
of tomorrow. By promoting classes and programs we hope to grow the number of
women of color working in technology and give underprivileged girls a chance
to become the masters of their technological worlds. Black Girls CODE's
ultimate goal is to provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy
some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the
U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.
