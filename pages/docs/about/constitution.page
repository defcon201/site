<h2>About DEFCON201</h2>
<h4>(Preliminary data - this is copied from the previous website for now.)</h4>
<p>
The DEFCON 201 (or DC201) Group is a gathering point for folks interested in
the alternate applications of science, technology, and other areas of
information security; referred to properly as 'hacking'.

Our mission is to help people learn new things, meet new people, mentor
others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the
hacker culture and it's members in the general New Jersey area.
We facillitate this through project collaborations, group gatherings, and
group activities that will best serve our community and the world.

<h4>Electronic Frontier Alliance Principles</h4>
<p>
As a member organization of the EFA, we believe that technology should
support the intellectual freedom at the heart of a democratic society.
In the digital age, that entails advancing:
</p>

<h5><strong>1. Free Expression</strong></h5>
<p>People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.</p>

<h5><strong>2. Security</strong></h5>
<p>Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.</p>

<h5><strong>3. Privacy</strong></h5>
<p>Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users
to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.</p>

<h5><strong>4. Creativity</strong></h5>
<p>Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the
ideas, creations, and inventions of others.</p>

<h5><strong>5. Access to Knowledge</strong></h5>
<p>Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.</p>

<h5>We uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.</h5>

<p>Can I attend if I only want to meet people?</p>

<h5>Answer:</h5>
<p>
We understand if people feel overwhelmed by the idea of working on projects.
If you want to show up to socialize, you are more than welcome to, but to get
the full experience of our group you can use your social skills to help out
with projects and DEFCON 201.
NEVER think that you are useless, everyone has a skill in something and if you
want to learn new ones, we are more than happy to teach you.
We are also looking into pure social gatherings in the near future and host
short talks on various STEM subjects.
