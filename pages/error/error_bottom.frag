                The DCG 201 (f/k/a DEFCON 201, DC201) Group is a gathering point
                for folks interested in the alternate applications of science, technology,
                and other areas of information security; referred to properly as 'hacking'.

                Our mission is to help people learn new things, meet new people,
                mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion
                within the hacker culture and it's members in the general New Jersey area.
                We facillitate this through project collaborations,
                group gatherings, and group activities that will best serve our community and the world.
